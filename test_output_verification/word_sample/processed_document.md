## Let’s swim!

To get started with swimming, first lay down in a water and try not to drown:

- You can relax and look around
- Paddle about
- Enjoy summer warmth

Also, don’t forget:

1. Wear sunglasses
2. Don’t forget to drink water
3. Use sun cream

Hmm, what else…

### Let’s eat

After we had a good day of swimming in the lake, it’s important to eat something nice

I like to eat leaves

Here are some interesting things a respectful duck could eat:

|         | Food                             |   Calories per portion |
|---------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Leaves  | Ash, Elm, Maple                  |                     50 |
| Berries | Blueberry, Strawberry, Cranberry |                    150 |
| Grain   | Corn, Buckwheat, Barley          |                    200 |

And let’s add another list in the end:
